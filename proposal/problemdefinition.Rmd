# The Problem

One of the biggest problems in science is the inadvertent destruction of data and the inaccessibility of data due to poor labeling and description of data. This loss of data means that studies cannot be replicated, combined or re-used in different settings [@Birney2014; @Wilkinson2016]. In the age of rapid digital data production the task of data management becomes more important, but also more challenging. The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System ([iRODS](https://irods.org/)) [@Rajasekar2010; @Rajasekar2015] is an open sourced data management software that offers a solution to this demand and encompasses the whole data life cycle from data generation, storage to recycling. Furthermore, a loosely constructed and highly configurable architecture frees the user from .. formats and single-vendor solutions. The open-sourced and community supported nature holds the promise that iRODS extends the usage of data in terms of longevity and independent of future technological innovations.

The problem for the average scientist can be the steep learning curve of using iRODS effectively for their day-to-day data management needs. Hence there have been multiple incentives to lower this barrier, among which the UU developed YODA - a front-end that hides part of the behind the scenes business logic that require knowledge of command line tools. Highly popular among academics are also higher level programming levels that help construct workflows for data analysis; data wrangling, statistics and visualization. On of the more notable platforms is the programming language R. Currently there is no straightforward solution to integrate iRODS data storage with R workflows. The R package *rirods* [@rirods], published on GitHub, which uses the iRODS C++ API, is currently stale and suffers from stringent system requirements constrains, which make it unsuitable for an easily installable, distributed method. This, furthermore, hampers publishing on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; the official R package archive) as interoperability among operating systems is mandatory for an R package to be eligible for publication.
