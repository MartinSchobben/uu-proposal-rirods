# Requirements

The realisation of this package requires a collaborative environment that includes the potential users, and their specific requirements for processing analytical data, as well as developers and data scientist with expertise in a range of disciplines. In regards to development, we brought together a multi-disciplinary team, and consulted experts of data management, machine learning, and the integration of C++ and R.

## People {#sec:people}

The project team will try to form a comprehensive picture of the current state of data management practices in laboratories through direct interaction with lab-users. In addition, they take control in all steps of development, documentation and outreach of the package. Dedicated consultants have been contacted and their expertise is regarded as an essential aid for successful deployment of the plan.

The project lead (MS) is an Earth scientist with 10 years of experience in academic research, and he has worked in several analytical laboratory facilities (MfN Berlin, University of Leeds, and Utrecht University). He also has a solid basis in data-analysis and programming with R, and has started developing packages for analysing isotope chemical data (see [point](https://martinschobben.github.io/point/)). Teaching and helping others to encode R solutions has been another of his passions, such as the development of [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r99jsChi4HU), and by founding of an R help desk at the UU ([uu-code-club](https://github.com/uu-code-club)).

TR oversees the iRODS development team and handles code review, package management, documentation, and high level architecture design. He's interested in distributed systems, metadata, security, and open source software that accelerates science. TR holds a Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and has been working on iRODS since 2008. In his current role, he also provides management and oversight of the iRODS Consortium.

## Processes

A prime controller in the initiation ... Feedback on these early developments is sought actively through our dedicated list of consultants, but also the community at large through Twitter and other channels. Throughout this process, we will make sure that the code of conduct, as outlined in Section \@ref(sec:Start), is adhered to.

<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

## Tools & Tech

For successful delivery of the package we need a suitaable platform for testing. GitHub is essential for the collaborative character of the work. No additional computing facilities are envisioned at the moment. 

<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?

## Funding

We request 

```{r itemized, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
Price <- c(759, 2500)
budget <- tibble::tibble(
  Item = c(
    "item 1", 
    "total"
  ),
  Currency = "$",
  Price = Price
)  
knitr::kable(budget, caption = "Itemized budget.", format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```
